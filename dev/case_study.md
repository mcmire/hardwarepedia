Case Study: Building a Rig
==========================

What do I want the site to do? Let's start with a scenario. Say I'm building a gaming computer. I could start with any component but let's start with the 

Video Card
----------

Naturally, I want to get my money's worth, so I'm looking for a card with the best value. I have a number of sites to use as a reference, so I start with Tom's Hardware. I flip to the [Gaming Graphics Cards 2009 page][1]. Hmm, not sure which chart to use so let's just try the [3DMark score][2]. Okay, it looks like the best card, period, is eVGA's GTX 295 Hydro Copper card. That's way too expensive, though, so I click on the $100-200 filter. I can cheat by changing the URL so the filter moves to [$150-250][3]. Okay, so it looks like the best one here is BFG's GTX 275. I want more information about this card, so I click on the checkbox next to it and click "Compare". Hmm, I get each benchmark score that goes into the final score, and things like the core clock speed and amount of memory, but that's it.

I can use gpureview.com to get the [details][4]. But ah, I don't really care about the details right now. Besides, this only gives me the specs for the chipset.

I've decided I want to find a card that can kill in Crysis. Let's go back to the benchmarks and find the benchmark for Crysis. Hmm, doesn't seem Tom's Hardware has one, that's weird. 

Never mind for right now. I look at some [more benchmarks on Tom's Hardware][6] and the [Video Card Superlatives at GPUReview][5] GPUReview for just a second. Judging from these pages, here are the cards I'm looking at and the prices pulled from Newegg (as of 9/21/09):

* GTX 260 (>$160)
* GTX 260 Core 216 (>$180)
* GTX 275 (>$200)
* GTX 280 (>$230)
* GTX 285 (>$325)
* GTX 295 (>$439-500)
* Radeon 4850 (>$100)
* Radeon 4870 (>$130)
* Radeon 4870 X2 (>$350)
* Radeon 4890 (>$190)

Let's take a different approach. Let's look at some roundups, because after all, comparisons are much more valuable than looking a card solo. Maximum PC probably have a few, as does Extremetech. Let's try Max PC first. A [budget card roundup][7] comes up first. In it basically you have the EVGA GeForce GTX 260 Core 216, HIS IceQ 4+ Radeon HD 4870, and EVGA GeForce GTX 275 at top, and the HD 4870 at $220 is named the best bang for the buck, with the GTX 275 a close second. All three achieve >60 fps in Crysis at 1680x1050 although that's without any AA. Hmm, [here's an article on the GTX 285][8]. Apparently it's not a good deal if you already have a GTX 280, Radeon HD 4870 X2, or even a GTX 260 Core 216. So that's out of the picture. The [4850 X2][9] beats out the 4870 and GTX 280, but hits a memory bandwidth wall when running Crysis on high settings or higher resolutions. The [GTX 260 Core 216][10] would have beat out the HD 4870 in the roundup except that HIS's card had DDR5 so that's why it was better. The [HD 4870 X2][11] is just a killer card, plain as day. It even ranks pretty high on Tom's Hardware benchmarks. 

Okay, so it's clear that benchmarks are useful, but they don't really tell the whole story -- for that you need actual reviews, with brief pros and cons. It would also be helpful to know what sort of release schedule Nvidia and ATI go by. There aren't that many video card reviews on Max PC, for instance -- after about so that if I come across an article written in January, for instance, I can tell whether or not the article is obsolete (if there is a newer card that has come out since then that beats the card). Also, when a review talks about "stream processors", what does that really mean? (Oh, ok, that ties into the shader stuff to render the image). Also, this isn't totally necessary, but it would be interesting to know all of the chipsets (the Radeon 4870, for instance, uses the R700 chipset (or does it use the RV770?)).

Alright, so where to go from here. Well I mentioned I'd take a look at Extremetech so let's see what they have. Okay, they have a recent [budget video card guide][12] and they recommend the HD 4870 and GTX 260. The GTX 275 doesn't have quite enough of a price point to be worth it over the 260. Same result in another review, a [shootout between the HD 4890 and GTX 275][13]: they aren't quite good of a deal over the cards they're displacing (the 4870 and GTX 260 core 216, respectively). 

Okay, so it looks like we're down to the HD 4870, GTX 260, and GTX 260 core 216 (and of course it depends on what modifications the vendor's made to the card). And if I really want to, the 4870 X2.

It seems that each review is a onion skin in a slice of time. Each review creates connections between one or more products, and sits at a specific point in time to create a sort of tapestry. Maybe that's what we need, a sort of timeline view.

It would also be nice to see a plot line of average prices of cards, and then on top of that overlay benchmarks (if we can do it), or some other helpful statistic. The goal here is to easily measure price over performance to gauge value - because if a card is 25% more expensive than the last but only 10% performant then it's not as good of a deal.

Hmm, here's are two reviews ([one][14], [two][15]) at BenchmarkReviews that point to the new(?) HD 4890 being a pretty good deal. It's a bit more than the GTX 260 and beats it out slightly in the benchmarks. I'm not sure how it fares against the GTX 260 Core 216, though. 

Yeah, reading reviews makes my head spin. I just want to get the main gist of the article. Actually basically I just want a summary of the conclusion. Also, it's frustrating that something like Tom's Hardware has a nice list of benchmarks for all sorts of cards.. but they don't have proper reviews.. or at least they don't link to the reviews from the benchmarks. On the flip side, BenchmarkReviews has really thorough reviews, and these reviews tend to compare other cards, but they don't have all their benchmarks in one place like Tom's Hardware does. 

Okay, one more go. It looks like judging from [this review][16] it looks like the HD 4890 scores higher than the GTX 260 core 216, but the guy that wrote the review doesn't recommend it because the HD 4870 1GB is really hard to beat. On the other hand, the 4890 is super overclockable. Here's a [review of the GTX 275][17] just to round things out and it looks to be a nice hybrid that bests the 4890 in some benchmarks (some of them favor Nvidia, some favor ATI), for about the same price, too. So it's really sort of a toss-up between the two.

[This graph][18] shows that the 275 doesn't eat as much power as the 4890 in idle. So that's kinda nice.

Okay, now that I know what chipset I want, now I need to find the actual card. This is kinda difficult because there are so many variants. Let's start on Newegg though since that's probably where I'll buy all this stuff from. So here are [all 18 GTX 275 cards][19]. Hmm, how do I limit this? I can't really compare them side-by-side, it takes too long to check the checkbox next to each item and it's too cumbersome. I mean I really wish there were an easier way to compare specs. Just basically give me all the specs I'm interested in, and highlight which product is the "winner" for each spec, and let me filter manually based on price or avg rating or something. Okay, I guess I have to do an advanced search. Ugh, I really wish if you selected one filter it would filter down the other filters. Like, if you selected GTX 275 it would look at all the available cards and then limit the remaining filters to only those that applied to the available cards. Okay, well I can limit the result set by manufacturer -- all the other specs are variable -- but that doesn't really help. Oh, I can filter by in-stock. There we go, now I'm down to [six][20]. I spend a good while on a Greasemonkey script that will highlight optimal specs in a comparison table, but finally I'm able to narrow it down to one product: a [GIGABYTE GV-N275UD-896I][20.1]. Even better, two of the reviews say that it runs Crysis fine at 4x AA without any visible lag. Awesome!

CPU
---

So that's the video card. The CPU is probably the next most important part so we'll go there next. I try to start with Tom's Hardware benchmarks to get a gauge of what's at the top. Again, this is hard since there are so many models to choose from. So let's try price range instead. I think I want to spend between $100-200. Okay, so I limit the benchmarks to [that][20]. Here we go. Hmm, that Phenom II X4 955 looks really good actually. I [look it up at Newegg][21] \(which is actually the Black Edition\). Winner of Customer Choice Award, $189, nice. That looks like a killer deal. See if I can find a review for it... ah yes, [one on Tom's Hardware][22]. It's not as good as things like the Intel Core i7 965 Extreme, but then again, that also costs your life savings. So for a mid-range card, it's pretty kickass. Plus it has an unlocked multiplier. Evidently AMD was aiming to equal Intel's Core 2 Quad Q9550, and it looks like they do.

So should I go with Intel or AMD? Because if I go with Intel, I have to watch out for [something I read on Tom's Hardware][23]: it seems that when pairing a Core i7 card with an Nvidia card, the performance is actually worse than i7 + an equivalent Radeon card. This looks to be due more to the Nvidia drivers and less to the performance on the card. Anyway, so I need a comparison between AMD and Intel. 

As with video cards, it would be helpful to see when Intel and AMD have released their new products, and what all the code names are and all that. Lynnfield, Bloomfield, Westmere, Nehalem, Clarksdale... desktop platform, mobile platform... i7 950, i7 850, i5 920... LGA 1156, LGA 1366... I get confused just reading summaries. And that's just Intel, AMD has its own set of code names and release names and whatnot.

Okay, I'll just start with Intel. As [this article][24] reveals, Intel just released their new Lynnfield procs early in September. Lynnfield is the successor to Bloomfield, which introduced Intel's new microarchitecture, Nehalem, last September. With Lynnfield we get a larger die size (296 mm² vs. 263 mm²), a different socket (LGA 1156 vs. LGA 1366), a different chipset (P55 vs. X58), and three new models (Core i7 870, Core i7 860, and Core i5 750) which are $100 cheaper than equivalent Bloomfield models. The only thing that is kept is the microarchitecture (still Nehalem) and the number of cores (4). 

Some perspective on pricing. Here's how it breaks down:

  | Intel Core i7 975 Extreme | Bloomfield | $999 |
  | Intel Core i7 965 Extreme | Bloomfield | $999 |
  | Intel Core i7 950         | Bloomfield | $562 |
  | Intel Core i7 940         | Bloomfield | $562 |
  | Intel Core i7 870         | Lynnfield  | $562 |
  | Intel Core i7 920         | Bloomfield | $284 |
  | Intel Core i7 860         | Lynnfield  | $284 |
  | AMD Phenom II X4 965 BE   |            | $245 |
  | Intel Core i5 750         | Lynnfield  | $196 |

Performance-wise, this means:

  | For this to be worth it... | it has to be same or better than... | it cannot be worse than... |
  | 870                        | 940                                 | 920                        |
  | 860                        | 920, 940                            |                            |
  | 750                        | 920, 940, and the Phenom            |                            |

Judging from [the benchmarks][24], it looks like of the two new procs, the 870 generally loses to the 975, and the 750 generally loses to the 920. The performance differences are 10-15%. However, look at the price differences: the 870 is almost 70% cheaper than the 975; the 750 is about 30% cheaper. And the best quad-core Phenom loses to the 750, too. 

Apparently, though, Intel is gearing up for another release later this year. It's really confusing but I think I've got it down, thanks to a number of articles ([one][25], [two][26], [three][27], [four][28], [five][29], [six][30]). Basically:

* Right now we're at Lynnfield (45nm)
* Later this year, Intel will move to a 32nm manufacturing process
* This is still the Nehalem microarchitecture (which was introduced last year), just at a smaller scale, and it's given the name Westmere (the "tick" in Intel's "tick-tock" cycle)
* Within Westmere are three products:
  * Clarkdale, for the mid-range desktop, will be a scaled-down Lynnfield
  * Arrandale, for mobile, will be a scaled-down Clarksfield (?)
  * Gulftown, for the high-end desktop, will supercede Bloomfield (Core i7 965 and 975)
* Clarkdale will actually become Core i3 and so it will sit below Lynnfield
* All three are scheduled for early next year, in that order
* While Clarkdale/Arrandale will step back from 4 cores to 2 cores, Gulftown will jump up from 4 cores to 6 cores
* Furthermore, while the 'dales will continue to use LGA1156, Gulftown will use LGA1366

And therein lies the rub. As [the Max PC article][27] describes, if you spend less now to go with Lynnfield, you can upgrade to Clarkdale, but it stops there. On the other hand, if you want to upgrade to Gulftown, you have to splurge on the i7 965 Extreme right now. But then again, I think probably this time next year, Intel will have come out with a successor to Lynnfield (on yet another socket).

So, I think I'll go with [the Core i5][30.1] for now.

Motherboard
-----------

Now that we've got the CPU out of the way, it's time to decide on a mobo. Fortunately I'm restricted to P55 mobos; unfortunately there are a variety of them. First stop is Newegg. Same thing as video cards and CPUs -- all the varieties are very similar. We can filter by a few things, though. I want ATX, LGA1156, and Firewire. That gives me [21 boards] [31]. If I'm willing to painstakingly check each box to compare, I can use my handy-dandy Greasemonkey script to quickly figure out the best one. Even with that though it's pretty overwhelming. So let's say max memory of 16GB, $100-200, 1 eSATA, 1 Ethernet. Okay, two results: [Asus P7P55D and ASRock P55 Extreme] [32], both at $150. Hmm, surely there are cheaper boards, what's the difference between these and cheaper ones? Let's do another search, removing the restriction on the memory, eSATA, and Ethernet. Ah, [this is more like it] [34]. Now let's compare these side-by-side. Okay, the [ASRock P55 Pro] [35] seems to be what I want, and it's cheap ($120), but there aren't any reviews. The [Asus P7P55D] [36] has reviews, but it's more expensive ($150). OTOH, [ASRock P55 Deluxe] [37] is pretty awesome too but it's $180, yikes.

I guess there really aren't that many P55 motherboards right now, and certainly not many that have been reviewed. Here's a review for the [ASRock P55 Deluxe] [38], but that's basically it. Probably in a month or two there will be more stuff.

So back to the original search. Again with the need for comparing specs more easily. Perhaps you could take all the products you are interested in and pick a spec and graph it. For instance, give me a line plot of the clock speed of these products. That'd be kinda nice. Although the problem here is that there are so many specs to consider it's kind of ridiculous.

Well this is interesting -- [here's a review for the ECS P55H-A] [39], which looks pretty good. And [here it is on Newegg] [40]. It doesn't have Firewire, though, crap! Well, maybe I don't really need that. I'd probably only use it to hook up my external drive, and I can already do that with eSATA. So maybe it's alright.

Oh, just in time! [Maximum PC just covered the MSI P55-GD80] [40.1]. Apparently it's great for overclocking. And it's got Firewire! Ah, but it's $210 [on Newegg] [40.2]. Not sure if I want to spend that much.

And here's a [recent roundup on Extremetech of four P55 mobos] [40.3]: [Asus P7P55D] [36] ($150), [Gigabyte GA-P55M-UD4][40.4] ($150), [Gigabyte GA-P55-UD6] [40.5] ($250), and [Intel DP55KG] [40.6] ($215). Judging from the article, it seems like the last two are more than what I need, and of the first two the Gigabyte is the better. Ugh, there's no way to pull a bunch of items together and compare them on Newegg - they have to be in a search to do that. Hmm. 

Aha, here's another timely review, [one from Tom's Hardware] [40.7]. It names the ASRock P55 Pro, Asus P7P55D, ECS P55H-A, Gigabyte P55-UD3R, and MSI P55-CD53. In the end, the Asus and Gigabyte are neck and neck. I guess the Asus is better? I'm not really sure. I'm kinda confused on all the motherboard specs. PCI 4x? PCI x16? I don't even know if the card I'm buying will fit. I guess it will, though. 

Judging by [this thread on Tom's Hardware] [60] it looks like either GIGABYTE GA-P55-UD4P or ASUS P7P55D (not Deluxe or Pro).

Memory
------

Alright, now for some memory. This should be pretty easy. The Asus mobo supports DDR3 1600, 1333, or 1066. It says it also supports 2200 at an overclocked speed but I'm not sure what that means. I guess I might as well get 4GB since it's pretty cheap I think. Anyway, some searching and I narrow it down to [14 results][41]. Hmm, interesting, [this one] [42] from Mushkin (which must be a new company) says it's engineered specifically for P55 boards. I guess it looks good. [This one][43] also by Mushkin is even faster, though it's $15 more. I guess it helps if you pick RAM that's been tested and designed for the chipset you've chosen. There's also [this one][43.1] by OCZ, but it's not quite as fast as the Mushkins.

Interesting thing about the OCZ (according to the reviews) is that you have to set the voltage to 1.9V to attain the advertised timings, they will not run stable at 1.5V or 1.65V at those low timings. That's probably the same for RAM in general too. I'm not sure whether it's good or bad if your RAM has a higher spec voltage, I guess that means you can overclock it more if you want. According to [this thread][43.2] you want to choose the RAM with the lower voltage. That would mean the Mushkin over the OCZ.

Actually, hmm, the OCZ OCZ3P1600LV4GK are lower voltage than the OCZ I just mentioned. Unfortunately Newegg doesn't have 'em right now. Timing isn't quite as good as the Mushkin anyways.

Alright, I'll just go with the Mushkin for right now.

Just found out in [this thread] [58] that the P55 chipset only supports RAM that's running at 1.65V or lower. Fortunately the Mushkin satisfies that requirement. (I think that's what they mean by "specially engineered for the P55 chipset".)

According to [this thread on Tom's Hardware] [60] the [OCZ Gold (OCZ3G16004GK)] [43.3] is about the best deal today, only $95. Timing's not as good as the Mushkin though.

Recap
-----

Okay, I want to see what we've got so far:

  +-------------------------------------------------+-------+
  | Gigabyte GV-N275UD-896I (GeForce GTX 275)       | $220  | 
  | Intel Core i5 750 (Lynnfield 2.66GHz Quad-Core) | $200  |

  | Mushkin 996746 (2x2GB, DDR3 1600 / PC3 12800)   | $116  |
  +-------------------------------------------------+-------+
  | Total                                           | $686  |
  +-------------------------------------------------+-------+
 
Case
----

I could easily spend like $200 on a case, but I really just want to spend up to like $70. Then again, I want to get one that has plenty of space. I especially want to get one that has those hard drive clip thingies. Oh, tool-less, that's what it's called. I want a case like that. 

I think we can probably check Maximum PC for what they typically use. Probably an Antec. Okay, go to their reviews, look up computer cases... oh, except their reviews are useless because you have to click on one to get the rating. And then you gotta look up the price separately. Man, maybe I need a Greasemonkey script for this too. So power search on Newegg is really the best way to search for things where everything's all in one place. Still a pain though 'cause there are so many checkboxes to check and it takes trial and error. And you have to actually think, okay, what are reliable brands that I want to limit this to. Okay, that takes too long, let's try limiting to $0-100 and then sorting by rating backwards. I wish I could sort by rating and price at the same time. 

Okay, [the Cooler Master RC-690-KKN1-GP][43] looks alright, it's tool-less but some reviews say the airflow isn't optimal and the front cover takes some effort to take off. The [Cooler Master Centurion 5 CAC-T05-UW] [44] is another cheap one with plenty of space, and it's also tool-less, but the airflow is terrible.

The [Antec Sonata III] [45] is one that a reviewer recommended, so I checked into that. It's more expensive at $100 but it seems to be a lot better. Easy to open, solid construction, looks nice, has pull-out trays, comes with a power supply. OTOH, it doesn't seem quite as quiet as advertised, the LEDs on the front are misleading, it's only a medium ATX, seems like the power supply is not a EarthWatts EA-500 as originally supplied, and someone said the airflow's not quite good enough for a gaming PC. So I'm not sure about this one. I think I need a full ATX case.

Someone mentioned something about Lian-Li but those cases are way too expensive.

One of Max PC's 2009 Dream Machines (and everyone and their mother, I'm sure) uses the [Antec 900] [46], which is only $100. Another one uses the {Thermaltake Element S} [47], which is $120 and seems to be better. I'll probably just go with that.

Cameron has the [NZXT Alpha] [51], it looks alright, but it's pretty cheap. 

Gonna have to do some research for this one. According to [this forum thread on Tom's Hardware] [47.5], I can get either a [Coolermaster HAF 932 for $140] [48], [Coolermaster Storm Scout for $90] [49], or an [Azza 1000 for $120 ($80 after rebate)] [50].

Here's an [old review on Tom's Hardware] [52] that covers the Antec 900, NZXT Adamas, Silverstone TJ09, and Zalman Fatal1ty. Surprisingly they have some good things to say about the Antec. That's pretty cool. However, the writer likes the Silverstone best. Looking it up on Newegg though - it's pretty expensive at $270. No thanks.

Here's a [newer review on Tom's Hardware][53] that covers a lot of mid-tower cases. In the end the Antec 300 comes away with the best bang for the buck, and the Best of Tom's Hardware goes to the Hiper Osiris.

Here's [another review that was just written][54] that covers newer cases like the ABS Canyon 595, Antec P193, Lian Li PC-X1000, NZXT Panzerbox, and Thermaltake Element G. The author seemed to like the Antec the best; it was the quietest for the least amount of money ($160). It wasn't the coolest, but that's a moot point since all five cases have relatively equal temperatures.

So that's three in a row that recommend Antecs. Hmm. Let's see how many Newegg has. Wait a minute. Look at the [reviews for the Antec 300] [55]. Crap. Maybe I should get that. Some guy says to replace the fans that come with the case with a 4-pack of Coolermaster 120mm fans. Like [these][56]. They don't push as much air as the more expensive ones. Then again, they're cheap. I imagine if you put all 4 of them in the case then lower speed, less air and quieter is better than higher speed, more air and louder.

I take a closer look at the [Antec 900][46], which has the highest rating for an Antec case on Newegg. I like how the USB ports and such are on the top of the case, that's nice. Hmm, seems to be bigger than the 300 and have better airflow. Probably a bit louder too, but whatever. Ooh, some review says it's a bit tight when installing newer (bigger) video cards; another says if you want SLI then you need to switch to the Antec 1200. Some reviews are also mentioning the 902 which has an eSATA port on the outside, as well as switches to control fan speed. Airflow is evidently fantastic on this thing. Okay, well, let's look at the 902. Ah, well, not much info there, just a slightly different design, but all in all about the same.

Power Supply
------------

The Antec 900/902 doesn't come with a power supply so I'll need to get one. Newegg has a 900 [here][56.1] that comes with a Antec EarthWatts EA650 650W. Hmm, [the PSU][56.2] looks pretty good. I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. One of Maximum PC's latest Dream Machines, they use a [Rosewill RP550V2-S-SL][56.3]; that's a 550W.

It'd be nice to know how much power my system is going to have. I think there's a tool online you can use to do that. [This one][56.4] looks pretty good. Here are the settings I use:

* System Type: 1 physical CPU
* Motherboard: Regular - Desktop
* CPU: Intel Core i5 750 2660 MHz Lynnfield
* CPU Utilization: 100%
* Overclock CPU from 2660 MHz / 1.3V to 3500 MHz / 1.4V
* RAM: 2 Sticks DDR3 SDRAM
* Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 275
* Hard Drive: 1 Regular SATA
* Drives: 1 DVD/CD-RW Combo Drive
* 2 USB Devices
* 1 Firewire Device
* 4 120mm fans, 1 250mm fan
* System Load: 100%

And the result is 412W. That's being pretty liberal but even so 550W should be plenty.

Heatsink/Cooler
---------------

Cameron has the [Zalman CNPS9900] [51] which is $60, I think I'll get that one. Only issue is it's pretty ginormous. Ooh, and it's only for socket 1366. Well, scratch that, then.

Hmm, time for a power search on Newegg. Ooh, I guess there's not that many of them - [this Thermaltake] [52] for $30 is the only one I could find. Hmm. May have to hold out on this and buy if really necessary.

Actually here's another one I found -- the [Cooler Master Hyper 212][52.1] for $30 as well. Reviews look good, nice price too.

Hard Drive
----------

Of course I also need a hard drive. For gaming what would be really cool is an SSD. I'm not sure what the good ones are, but I think Maximum PC has probably reviewed some, they're into that sort of thing. [Here's a recent review of a record-breaking SSD][53]. But holy schmoly, is it expensive -- $400 for 128GB? Please. Makes me wonder whether I should even get an SSD or not. Lots of other people feel the same way judging from forum posts and that sort of thing. I think I might just get a [Barracuda 7200.12][54]. Hell yes.

[54]: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148433

Optical Drive
-------------

Only thing left I need is an optical drive. I'm thinking just a DVD/CD-RW should be sufficient. Maximum PC recommends the [Samsung SH-S223][55]. Looks good to me. There's a variant that has LightScribe with it but I'm never going to use that. ZipZoomFly actually has it slightly cheaper [here][56].

Monitor
-------

I'll probably need a monitor at some point. Judging by [this thread on Tom's Hardware] [60], the [LG W2353V-PF][57] is a really good gaming monitor. Fair price too, I guess. Can't adjust the height but maybe that doesn't matter in this case. Reviews are stellar.

Covering My Bases
-----------------

At this point I want to take a look at what other Core i5 systems people have built. So basically I just do a search for "gaming i5 system" and kinda go through the results and add a few things to my list as necessary. [This thread on Tom's Hardware][58] is a good starting point.

While I'm there I decide, heck, let's see what else is on the Tom's Hardware forums. So then I come across [this guide to choosing parts][59], and it's pretty informative. And also [this list of recommended sites and components][60] by a long-time forum user.

[58]: http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/270899-31-game-system-1500

Wrapping Up
-----------

So what is the ideal procedure for putting together a rig? Well, it starts with deciding 1) what the rig will be for and 2) how much you're willing to spend. Unfortunately, computers can't read your mind yet so only you can decide these things. After this you can step through each component you'll need. Usually you want to start with the motherboard as basically all of the other components will depend on it. If your computer will be for gaming, though, then you can start with the video card.

Regardless though, the first thing you really need to do is to do a gain some knowledge about the component you're shopping for. If you're looking for a CPU, you might want to know what makes AMD different from Intel, or what sort of sockets are out there. If a video card, you might want to know what pixel pipelines and stream processors are, or what the difference between DirectX 9 and DirectX 10 is. If RAM, then you might want to know what the numbers in the timing mean. You may not want to squeeze as much power from your rig as possible but knowing these things will help you to make a well-informed decision.

Once you've done that, you're ready to actually start searching. When you're on a new component, usually you have some sense (however variant) of what you want to buy. For instance, maybe you have a certain price range, performance level, or speed in mind; maybe you want to go with a certain brand; maybe you want certain features; or maybe you just want something that's "good". What you have in mind will dictate the approach you'll take. If you don't really know what you're looking for, then you might want to seek recommendations or read reviews to get an idea of what most other people tend to use within your price range. Or you might consult a benchmark sheet to see what the most capable items are. Or you might look at a list of what's hot this year or what was hot last year (since that won't be as pricey). If you do have certain criteria in mind, however, you might want to search for available products that fit that criteria.

Either way, you will likely reach a point where you have a set of possible products. Now you need a way to find where they stand next to each other, to find out which is the best one. So you might compare speed, quality, power, what technology it supports, and most of all, price. Some of this information is peripheral, some of it pedantic. But some of it can be evaluated and graphed. Hopefully, though, all of the data can help you "zoom out" and place the products you're thinking about in context. Most importantly, it can help you discover the "sweet spot" -- the point at which performance crosses price. For instance, if the system can tell you that one product is 30% more expensive than the other but is only 10% more performant, then you know that it's probably a waste of money to buy.

However, simply comparing features or benchmarks is just one half of making a properly informed decision. Once you find something that looks good you'll want to read what other people have written about it, so you can corroborate your findings and so you know what to expect before you actually buy it. Now there are several places where you can get this information: print magazines like PC Magazine, online news and reviews sites like Tom's Hardware or HardOCP or Anandtech or Extremetech, benchmarking sites like BenchmarkReviews.com, various forums sites, and countless comments on places like Amazon and Newegg. Information is all over the place, and while linking to every mention of a product on every site would be too much, you'd really like a list of links to reputable sites that give some substantial dirt on the product you're looking at -- and you want it to be automatically updated, too, so if you come back two months later there's more information. And, if you really want to get the raw meat then you might want a general list of (again, reputable) sites you can browse.

If you're really pinching pennies, one thing that might help you see the wider picture is to know when the manufacturers (the big three, Intel, AMD, and Nvidia; and possibly various lesser knowns) release their products so that you can time your final purchase. Manufacturers usually have some sort of long-term (3-5 years) goals although sometimes even immediate releases are not fully known until about 3 months away. So this knowledge might not be helpful but it could be informative if you're into that sort of thing.

So you've come to the end of the process. Here's where it gets vague depending on what you're doing. Either you're building a new computer, in which case you have a configuration you've put together. Or you don't really have a configuration, you're just buying a new part or two for a computer you already have. But let's say you're building a new one, and maybe you're not ready to purchase right now, maybe you're holding out for the latest and greatest. But you've got this configuration you've built, so why not just stash it away somewhere so you can come back to it later. Or maybe you're proud of it and you want to just give it a name and share it with other people. Maybe the system gives it a score and lets you compare with other people.

But let's say you *are* ready to purchase. Either you're already going with a vendor, or you really want to get the best deal and so you're going to mix and match vendors. Maybe you want to compare prices from reputable computer stores (Best Buy, Newegg, TigerDirect, Amazon). But you can probably do that on other sites if you want ;)

__END__

Usually the first thing you'll need to know is what you're looking for. But to do that, depending on what sort of system you're building, you may need to do some research and find out a little about each component. After you've done this you'll want a way to know what products are on the market that fit within the criteria you've set. And you'll want a way to know where different products stand next to each other. Which ones are better? Why is this one better than that one? There are several ways to gain this information. Some components (video cards, CPU) have benchmarks that give each component a number. Another component can then be benchmarked and given a number, and in so doing, placed in a rank. Other components (cases, RAM) don't really have benchmarks, but you can usually tell which ones are better by comparing the specifications. In order to do this, though, you have to know which specifications are significant (because some aren't). As you're comparing specifications, though, what you really want to know is, is what I'm looking at a good value for the money? Once you've made a comparison between two products then this part is easy, all you do is compare the differences between the performance/quality and the price of both products (difference of a difference). 

You might also just want to get an idea of what other people use and recommend. And to do this it helps if you know what all the good sites are out there. Tom's Hardware, HardOCP, and BenchmarkReviews.com are just a few. As long as you know where to go then all you have to do is look up which product you're looking at, or just browse the site to find a roundup or something. In other words, this part can't be done automatically either, you'll just have to educate yourself. But, maybe if you had a list of recommended products for each component (what's new, what's old) then you wouldn't have to do so much searching.
