Project Xenon
=============

This is the source code for an app I'm working on, which I've code-named hardwarepedia.

Let's say you want to build a computer from scratch, or you already have a computer but you want to look for some computer parts. Maybe you're an amateur or experienced gamer, or you're just someone who may not be so technically inclined but you've decided that you don't want to order a computer from Dell, you want to try your hand at buying computer parts and doing the work yourself. The problem is that if you don't know what you're looking for, or you don't know much about what you're looking for, there aren't many good places to go to easily get good information. Sure, you can look up parts on Newegg and read reviews, or you can visit sites that list benchmarks, or you can peruse forums to get first-hand advice, but you have to spend a lot of time doing this. But you don't have a lot of time, you want to get enough information to make a purchase today or tomorrow, not a month from now.

So what this site will provide is a way to get information about every computer hardware product in existence today. The information will include specifications, pricing, links to mentions (reviews, benchmarks) in magazines, e-zines, and sites like Newegg. In addition, every product will be given a ranking (based on several factors; the algorithm will be fully explained so you know what's going on) so you can see where it stands among other products within the same category. This information will be constantly updated -- because no one likes a site that has outdated information -- but you will also be able to go in and edit any information that may be incorrect, because sometimes machines get it wrong. You'll be able to search or sort by any parameter using an intuitive, helpful interface, and comparisons between different products will actually be intelligent -- not just a simple table with all of the data values available listed.

But let's say you're building a computer, and you have no idea where to start. In that case, you'll be given a walkthrough. For instance, starting with the motherboard, you'll be asked questions, such as "will you be using this for gaming or casual use" or even more advanced things like "do you like Intel or AMD". Once you've chosen a motherboard, you can move onto the CPU. The choices you are given will be based on the motherboard you've chosen. Throughout the process, if you want to get information about a product, you can do that at any time. You will also be able to save your computer configuration as you go along to a list, so that if you're not ready to make a purchase, you can come back to it, or you can show it to your friends or whoever. But if you are ready to make a purchase, you'll be given the average price of each component you've selected, and you'll be offered to buy them from different places (Newegg, Buy.com, etc.)

Finally, it is my plan to expose all of the data that will be collected, so you are free to make your own mashups.

So that's kind of the idea. As far as I know, no site does all of this, or if it does, the user experience is horrible.
