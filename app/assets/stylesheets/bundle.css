/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * All paths listed below are included in the asset bundle.
 * You can use `require` to add a file to the bundle. You can also use
 * `require_tree` to add the contents of an entire directory.
 *
 * When resolving paths listed below, the asset load path is used. You can see
 * what the value of this is by typing
 * `pp Rails.application.config.asset.paths` in the Rails console.
 *
 * Please note that `require_tree` (and `require_directory`) must be a relative
 * path. In other words, if you are trying to `require_tree foo` and foo/ is
 * in vendor/assets/javascripts, this will not work. You will need to make a
 * file vendor/assets/javascripts/foo.js with the contents of
 * `require_tree "./foo"`.
 * See here for more: <https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/issues/183>
